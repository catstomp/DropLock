Plugin version: 1.0
Author: Antagonist, with heaps of help from Ijwu

This is my first ever TShock plugin, currently it prevents players from dropping items if they do not have the permission "dropitem". It's to prevent hackers from coming in, spawning and dropping items in your SSI server. I hope to expand on this plugin's anti-hacks in the future.
